 
0.5.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Synced proplib code with NetBSD HEAD, which replaces the red-black tree
   implementation and checks for NULL pointers passed in to the _dict/_array
   functions.

 * The _zfile functions in the API are now encapsulated into its own file,
   that way upstream changes are merged easily.

 * The list of public API exported symbols is now handled via libtool's
   -exported-symbols option so that local symbols don't pollute the API.

 * Explicitly require a C99 compiler. Don't want to waste time in non C99
   compilers.

 * Build with Stack Smashing Protection if supported by the compiler, and
   a bunch of compiler warnings.

0.4.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * When externalizing a file with the _file variant, it was always writting
   gzipped archives but without compression, this added garbage into the
   plist files, thus not being compatible.

0.4
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Added support to internalize (read) and externalize (write) plist
   files compressed with gzip(1) (by using the compatible zlib interface).

   The ABI has not been touched, some new functions have been added:
    - prop_array_externalize_to_zfile()
    - prop_array_internalize_from_zfile()
    - prop_dictionary_externalize_to_zfile().
    - prop_dictionary_internalize_from_zfile().

   Due to this additions, zlib is now required. The _zfile() variants are
   able to internalize/externalize from uncompressed plist files as well.

0.3
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Add strlcat again with an autoconf check.
 * Emit decimal numbers rather than hex when externalizing unsigned numbers.
 * A bugfix from NetBSD that properly handles empty data nodes, ie
   <data></data>.

0.2
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A bugfix from NetBSD that fixes two race conditions that could corrupt
   the red-black tree to store the objects.
 * Added some more tests to configure.ac.

0.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Initial public release matching libprop from NetBSD 4.99.73.
