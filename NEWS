0.6.6
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Synced code with NetBSD HEAD, bringing some bugfixes and misc changes.
 - Don't treat NUL (EOF) as SPACE. All the code that uses _PROP_ISSPACE() checks
explicitly for _PROP_EOF() anyway, and this can be abused to cause run beyond
the end of buffer DoS (Mateusz Kocielski).
 - Misc fixes to manual pages.
 - Eliminate use of C++ keywords and don't nest struct definitions.

0.6.5
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Use GCC atomic builtins for reference counting, if the compiler supports
   it. Merged from xbps.
 * Added prop_array_add_first(), analogue to prop_array_add() but appends obj
   to the head, rather than at the tail. Merged from xbps.
 * Multiple random fixes merged from xbps.
 * Properly detect fdatasync() on MacOS; patch by Kirk Rusell.

0.6.4
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Properly enable fdatasync(3) if it's found in configure.
 * Synced code with NetBSD HEAD, bringing some bugfixes and portability changes.

0.6.3
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Removed NetBSD specific code and defines for kernel/standalone.
 * Portability fixes to allow building with the musl C library.

0.6.2
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Improve performance of prop_xxx_internalize_from_zfile() when plist is
   already uncompressed.
 * When externalizing plists and if fdatasync(2) is available, use it
   rather than fsync(2) which can be expensive some times.

0.6.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Fixed a syntax error in generated pkg-config file.
 * Fixed zlib's decompressor code to work with 1.2.6.
 * Changed zlib's decompressor to process chunks of 8K. This seems to give
   a small performance improvement to many real cases.

0.6.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Synced proplib with NetBSD HEAD, with the following changes:
	- Fixed a segfault in prop_dictionary_equals(3).
	- New interfaces added to prop_{array,dictionary}_util(3):
		* prop_array_set_and_rel()
		* prop_dictionary_set_and_rel()
		* prop_dictionary_get_dict()
	- Markup, typos, etc for the manual pages.

 * New interfaces added to prop_array_util(3):
	* prop_array_add_cstring()
	* prop_array_add_cstring_nocopy()

0.5.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Added pkg-config support and install a proplib.pc file.

 * Merged stuff from old subversion repo, that re-added the change to emit
   base 10 rather than base 16 for unsigned numbers contributed by Adam Hoka.
  
0.5.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Synced proplib code with NetBSD HEAD, which replaces the red-black tree
   implementation and checks for NULL pointers passed in to the _dict/_array
   functions.

 * The _zfile functions in the API are now encapsulated into its own file,
   that way upstream changes are merged easily.

 * The list of public API exported symbols is now handled via libtool's
   -exported-symbols option so that local symbols don't pollute the API.

 * Explicitly require a C99 compiler. Don't want to waste time in non C99
   compilers.

 * Build with Stack Smashing Protection if supported by the compiler, and
   a bunch of compiler warnings.

0.4.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * When externalizing a file with the _file variant, it was always writting
   gzipped archives but without compression, this added garbage into the
   plist files, thus not being compatible.

0.4
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Added support to internalize (read) and externalize (write) plist
   files compressed with gzip(1) (by using the compatible zlib interface).

   The ABI has not been touched, some new functions have been added:
    - prop_array_externalize_to_zfile()
    - prop_array_internalize_from_zfile()
    - prop_dictionary_externalize_to_zfile().
    - prop_dictionary_internalize_from_zfile().

   Due to this additions, zlib is now required. The _zfile() variants are
   able to internalize/externalize from uncompressed plist files as well.

0.3
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Add strlcat again with an autoconf check.
 * Emit decimal numbers rather than hex when externalizing unsigned numbers.
 * A bugfix from NetBSD that properly handles empty data nodes, ie
   <data></data>.

0.2
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A bugfix from NetBSD that fixes two race conditions that could corrupt
   the red-black tree to store the objects.
 * Added some more tests to configure.ac.

0.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Initial public release matching libprop from NetBSD 4.99.73.
