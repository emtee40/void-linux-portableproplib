Portable Property container object library
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The proplib library provides an abstract interface for creating and
manipulating property lists.  Property lists have object types for
boolean values, opaque data, numbers, and strings.  Structure is provided
by the array and dictionary collection types.

Property lists can be passed across protection boundaries by translating
them to an external representation.  This external representation is an
XML document whose format is described by the following DTD:

This proplib version is the same version than is available on NetBSD, but
with the exception that NetBSD specific code has been removed and
it has been converted to be built throught the GNU autotools. Also since 0.4,
the API has diverged a bit, notably this version supports reading and writting
gzipped compressed plist files thanks to zlib (implemented by myself).

It should be mentioned that NetBSD's proplib code is a free,
clean room and from scratch implementation based in the specifications
available for Mac OS X, written by Jason R. Thorpe.

I'd like to thank you Jason R. Thorpe for such a great library.
